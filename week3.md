I spent more than two days carefully watching this course.
In addition, I supplemented my learning by watching another video tutorial on YouTube:

##    Reflection.
During the second week of the exercise, I realized that I incorrectly completed the first and second week's tasks. As a result, I had to spend more time building a website using SiteGround and readjusting my activities to the course requirements. After watching the instructional videos, I managed to learn how to use WordPress, although I was a little unsure about the specific deliverables required for the assignment. After reviewing a few resources and seeking advice from friends, I had a clear idea of what was required.

##    The Process
First, I reviewed the course materials to understand the objectives for the week. Then, I created a detailed schedule to ensure I had enough time to thoroughly watch the instructional videos. After that, I registered and logged into WordPress to set up my site. I imported the WordPress content into SiteGround and linked both accounts, which helped make it easier to create and modify content. Using the provided template, I successfully created content for my WordPress site.

##    Conclusion
Overall, once I understood the requirements, the process went smoothly. The instructional videos were very useful and provided clear and concise instructions on how to use WordPress. Despite some initial confusion, I managed to complete the task effectively, gaining valuable skills in WordPress CMS and website management. The learning experience enhanced my understanding of several key concepts and vocabulary related to CMS and web development, and website management is now much clearer to me!
