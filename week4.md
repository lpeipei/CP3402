## Reflection
This week, we delved into the complexities of creating and deploying a website using a content management system (CMS) and the importance of workflow. Our focus included several key areas that are critical to a full understanding of modern web development. Below are the key points for reflectiion

## Content Management System Development and Deployment
Last week we explored the process of creating and editing content in a content management system, highlighting the importance of customizing templates or themes to ensure that the site is unique and customizable. In addition, we covered basic site management tasks that are critical to maintaining the health and performance of a CMS-based site. The ability to effectively manage content and customize the user experience through themes is an essential skill for all web developers.

## Installation and Maintenance Considerations
Understanding the installation and maintenance requirements of a modern website is critical. We've looked at different scenarios and best practices for setting up a content management system, which is often more complex than a static website. This includes the need for a server capable of executing scripts (usually PHP) and a database server, which may or may not be on the same machine as the web server. This knowledge is essential to ensure that our website runs smoothly and efficiently.

## Development workflow for a CMS website
We evaluated various development workflows for the CMS website. This included comparing local development environments with production environments and understanding the importance of working as closely together as possible. We learned the benefits of using local hosting software such as WAMP, XAMPP, and AMPPS, which contain all the applications (Apache, MySQL, and PHP) needed to run the CMS locally. However, we have also noticed differences between local and production environments, such as case sensitivity of file names between Windows and Linux.

## Importance of Linux/Unix Experience
A key takeaway was the importance of gaining experience with Linux/Unix systems. Since most virtual hosts run on Linux and many development tools are designed for this environment, it is critical to be familiar with Linux. We discussed the advantages of using a virtual machine (VM) running the full Linux operating system. This approach provides a development environment that more closely resembles a production environment, makes it easier to manage, and reduces the likelihood of deployment problems.

## The Importance of Workflow
A good workflow includes version control, which can help developers avoid some risks. For example, version controllers such as github allow you to go back and view history, and pull remote code to reset when there are problems in the local development environment.

## Summary
In summary, this week's focus on content management system development and deployment has provided a solid foundation for building and maintaining modern websites. The in-depth knowledge of different environments, the importance of Linux/Unix experience, and the practical challenges of coordinating development and production setups have been invaluable. Going forward, these skills will become critical as we continue to develop more complex and dynamic web projects.
